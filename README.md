## 📌 Programs Included

### 1. Add Two 8-bit Numbers

* Adds two immediate 8-bit hexadecimal numbers.
* Demonstrates basic arithmetic using the accumulator.
* **Concepts:** MVI, ADD, Registers, Flags

### 2. Store 8-bit Data at a Memory Location

* Stores the value `29H` at memory address `3005H`.
* Uses the HL register pair for memory addressing.
* **Concepts:** HL pair, Memory access, MVI M

### 3. Find the Largest of Two Numbers

* Compares two 8-bit numbers and stores the larger one in the accumulator.
* Implements conditional branching.
* **Concepts:** CMP, JC, Conditional logic

## 📚 Learning Roadmap

This repository will continue to grow with programs covering:

* Arithmetic with carry and borrow
* Memory-based operations
* Loops and counters
* Array processing
* Sorting algorithms
* Stack and subroutine concepts
* Input/Output instructions
